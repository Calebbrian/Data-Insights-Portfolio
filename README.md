# Data Insights Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Insights Portfolio! This repository contains various data analysis projects showcasing my ability to extract insights, clean data, and visualize results using Python. Below are brief descriptions of the projects included:

## Projects

### 1. **Uber Drives Analysis**  
This project involves analyzing Uber trip data from 2016. Key insights include:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and converting date formats.
- **Trip Duration Analysis:** Calculating average trip duration by category (business/personal).
- **Distance Analysis:** Analyzing average miles per trip, with detailed breakdown by purpose.
- **Time-Based Analysis:** Analyzing trips by hour, day, and month.
- **Purpose Analysis:** Understanding the most common reasons for trips and their durations.

### 2. **Superstore Sales Analysis**  
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from a Superstore. Key insights include:
- **Data Cleaning:** Removing duplicates and handling missing values.
- **Sales by Region and Category:** Visualizing total sales for different regions and sub-categories.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Using ARIMA models to forecast future sales trends.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Creating an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to categorize customers.

### 3. **Dates & Values: Time Series Analysis and Forecasting**
This project focuses on the analysis of a dataset containing dates and values, showcasing advanced time series analysis techniques.

#### Key Insights:
- **Data Cleaning**: Assigning appropriate column names and handling missing values.
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Breaking down the dataset into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying significant anomalies in the dataset.
- **Lag Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing relationships between values across different time lags.
- **ARIMA Forecasting**: Predicting future values using an ARIMA model.
